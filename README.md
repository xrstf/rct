Rollercoaster Tycoon for Go
===========================

This is a collection of libraries to read (and sometimes write) data files and savestates from
RCT 1. It's a pure fun project, incomplete and probably buggy.

The code is tested using RCT1 Deluxe Edition, as it's [available on gog.com](http://www.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_deluxe).
